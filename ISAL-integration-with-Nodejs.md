ISA-L integration with Node.js
=============================
## About This Document
This document descibes ISA-L integration with Node.js. It's aiming to empower Node.js users with Intel ISA-L algrithoms to accelerate storage functionalities on Intel architectures.

This document also describes the strategies about integrating ISA-L into Node.js and provides an example demontrating how efficient ISA-L is working with Node.js.

## Overview
With web & HTML5 technologies development, Node.js is adopted by more and more companies to build fast scable web applications. Node.js is perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices because it uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O programming model.
